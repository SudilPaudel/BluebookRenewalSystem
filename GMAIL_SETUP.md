## ðŸš€ Quick Setup for Email Notifications

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. **Go to your Google Account**
   - Visit [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)
   - Sign in with your Gmail account

2. **Navigate to Security**
   - Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
   - Find "2-Step Verification" and click on it

3. **Enable 2-Step Verification**
   - Click "Get started"
   - Follow the setup process (usually involves your phone number)
   - Complete the verification

### Step 2: Generate App Password

1. **Go back to Security**
   - After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to Security settings

2. **Find App Passwords**
   - Scroll down to find "App passwords" (under 2-Step Verification)
   - Click on "App passwords"

3. **Generate New App Password**
   - Select "Mail" from the dropdown
   - Select "Other (Custom name)" if "Mail" is not available
   - Enter a name like "Bluebook System"
   - Click "Generate"

4. **Copy the Password**
   - Google will generate a 16-character password
   - It looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - **Copy this password** (remove the spaces)

### Step 3: Update Your Environment File

1. **Open your `.env` file**
   - Navigate to `Server/.env`
   - Update these values:

```env
# Replace with your actual Gmail
SMTP_USER=your_actual_gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
SMTP_FROM=your_actual_gmail@gmail.com
```

**Example:**
```env
SMTP_USER=john.doe@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=abcd1234efgh5678
SMTP_FROM=john.doe@gmail.com
```

### Step 4: Test Email Configuration

1. **Restart your server**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the email functionality**
   - Register a new user account
   - Try making a payment
   - Check your email for OTP

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"
**Solution:** You're using your regular Gmail password instead of the App Password

#### 2. "App passwords not available"
**Solution:** Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled first

#### 3. "Less secure app access"
**Solution:** Use App Passwords instead of enabling less secure apps

### Security Notes:

1. **Never share your App Password**
2. **Use different App Passwords for different applications**
3. **You can revoke App Passwords anytime from Google Account settings**
4. **The App Password is only shown once - copy it immediately**
